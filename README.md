# Topics_Econometrics_Statistics_Project_2023
A project based on Hirano et al (2003) with R sample codes and experimental codes for full estimation - very high computing power required for full estimation, otherwise impossible. The unrestricted MLE estimation methods that use heuristic algorithms are written in more primal C language and do not work efficiently that could guarantee a solution.
